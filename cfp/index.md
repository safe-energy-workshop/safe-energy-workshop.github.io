    <li><b> Original Research Paper:</b> Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Paper submissions must be at most 4 single-spaced US Letter (8.5"x11") pages, including figures, tables, and appendices (excluding references). All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>.
