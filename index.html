<p>SAFE-ENERGY brings together researchers for the advancement of trust-worthy machine learning for energy systems.</p>

<p>SAFE-ENERGY is designed as a venue to initiate conversations that the field needs to have to move beyond application of vanilla ML models towards models that can actually be relied upon in critical infrastructure such as the energy grid. Despite the pressing need for this move, there is scant evidence that it will happen on its own due to a growing academia-industry divide. The discussions in the workshop will be informed by experiences from organizing several ML-related competitions, industrial collaborations, and the findings of several International Energy Agency (IEA-EBC) Annexes.</p>

<p>SAFE-ENERGY’24 will be held in conjunction with <a href="https://energy.acm.org/conferences/eenergy/2024/index.php">e-Energy’24</a>.</p>
